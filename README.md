#Mastercard Masters of Code NYC Nov 2015 collaboration.

This project is an incomplete 24 hour collaboration aimed at using Mastercard APIs to develop an app. The app in question here was **Hot or Cold**, an app aimed at letting you know what bars in New York City is happening (hot) and which aren't (cold), using the Places API.

My part in this was to create the backend. Using Python, the backend receives zip codes from the command line, pulls up locations within that area accepting Mastercard, and parses the XML to be sent to the frontend for use with Google Maps to populate the map.
